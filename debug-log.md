## Bug 001 — CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) on Ad Zone Wrappers

**Bug:**
- **Description:** Ad zone wrapper divs (`.ad-zone-a`, `.ad-zone-inline`, `.ad-zone-c`) had no explicit `min-height`, causing the page to jump when the AdSense script loaded and injected `<ins>` elements.
- **Location:** `styles.css` — `.ad-zone-a` (line ~400), `.ad-zone-inline` (line ~405), `.ad-zone-c` (line ~1124)
- **Root Cause:** Only `.ad-slot` (the inner `<ins>` container) had `min-height: 90px`. The outer wrapper zones had no reserved vertical space, so before the ad loaded, the wrapper had 0 height and the page collapsed — causing a layout shift when the ad expanded it.

**Fix:**
- **Summary:** Added `min-height: var(--ad-banner-h)` to `.ad-zone-a` and `.ad-zone-inline`, and `min-height: 328px` to `.ad-zone-c` (280px native ad + 24px top/bottom padding).
- **Files Changed:** `styles.css`
- **Why It Works:** Reserving the height in the *wrapper* (not just the inner slot) prevents the page layout from reflow-after-load, eliminating CLS. The CSS variable `--ad-banner-h` is already defined in the root and used by `.ad-slot`, so using it on the wrapper keeps values in sync.

**Prevention:**
- **Rule or Pattern:** Any element that contains a dynamically injected ad unit (AdSense `<ins>`, GPT slot, etc.) must have an explicit `min-height` on the *outermost* container div, not just the inner slot element.
- **Future Safeguard:** When adding new ad zones, always add `min-height` to the zone wrapper at the same time as the inner `<ins>` element.

## Bug 002 — AdSense "Thin Content" / Low-Value Content Risk on Calculator Pages

**Bug:**
- **Description:** All 68 calculator tool pages had `seoContent` sections with only ~100–160 words each — well below the 300-word minimum recommended for AdSense approval. Google's content crawlers evaluate each URL independently; thin `seoContent` risks "low value content" policy violations.
- **Location:** All files in `js/tools/*.js` — specifically the `seoContent` template literal property.
- **Root Cause:** Initial `seoContent` was written as a quick placeholder, with only 1–2 short paragraphs and 1–2 FAQ items. Volume was prioritized over depth during initial build.

**Fix:**
- **Summary:** Systematically expanded `seoContent` for the 8 highest-priority tools to 350–600 words each. Content added includes: formula derivation, worked numerical examples, classification tables, historical context, real-world use cases, comparison data (benchmarks, US standards), and 3–5 `<details>` FAQ accordions per tool.
- **Files Changed:** `js/tools/prime.js`, `js/tools/triangle.js`, `js/tools/study-planner.js`, `js/tools/tip.js`, `js/tools/tip-split.js`, `js/tools/bmi.js`, `js/tools/water.js`, `js/tools/salary.js`, `js/tools/unit.js`
- **Why It Works:** Deeper, unique, instructional content gives Google's Quality Rater Guidelines signals of E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). The `<details>` accordion FAQ format also targets voice search and featured snippet eligibility while keeping the visual UI clean.

**Prevention:**
- **Rule or Pattern:** All new tool `seoContent` sections must contain: (1) a 2–3 sentence intro paragraph, (2) the formula with a worked example, (3) one `<h3>` classification/comparison section, (4) one `<h3>` real-world context section, and (5) minimum 3 `<details>` FAQ items.
- **Future Safeguard:** When adding any new tool to `js/tools/`, use the BMI or Water tool as a template — both now meet and exceed the 300-word standard.

## Bug 003 — AdSense Rejection: "Ads on screens without publisher-content" + "Low value content" (Real Root Cause)

**Bug:**
- **Description:** AdSense rejected the site citing both flags even after Bug 002's content expansion. The actual cause was structural, not content depth: all 68 "tool pages" were routed purely via URL hash (`#mortgage`, `#bmi`, etc.), and Google does not crawl or index fragment URLs as distinct pages — `precisioncalc.com/#mortgage` and `precisioncalc.com/#bmi` both collapse to the same canonical URL, `precisioncalc.com/`. The hardcoded `<link rel="canonical">` reinforced this. So no matter how much `seoContent` existed per tool, Google's crawler only ever saw one page: the thin home screen (a one-line hero, a few short feature-card blurbs, and a grid of icon links) sitting under 4–6 simultaneous ad placements (Zone A, A2, B, D, plus per-category multiplex ads). That is a textbook match for both rejection reasons.
- **Location:** `js/app.js` router (`route()`, hash-only), `index.html` canonical/OG tags (hardcoded to homepage), `sitemap.xml` (listed `#fragment` URLs Google can't index separately).
- **Root Cause:** Hash-based SPA routing with no static/server-rendered fallback per route. Content-depth fixes (Bug 002) never reached Google because they only rendered client-side after a hash the indexer doesn't treat as a separate URL.

**Fix:**
- **Summary:** Added a static pre-render build step (`scripts/build-static-pages.js`) that generates a real, physical `/<id>/index.html` for every tool — full calculator UI + seoContent baked into the initial HTML, unique `<title>`/`<meta description>`/canonical/OG tags per tool. `js/app.js`'s router now also accepts real paths (`currentPathSlug()` fallback in `route()`), and a global click-delegation layer intercepts internal `<a href="/id/">` clicks to do fast client-side `pushState` transitions while keeping the links fully crawlable and functional with JS off. All internal links (sidebar, feature cards, complete grid, search results) were converted from `href="#id"` to `href="/id/"`. `sitemap.xml` now lists real paths instead of hash fragments. All asset references in `index.html` were made root-relative (`/styles.css` etc.) so the one-level-deep tool subpages resolve them correctly.
- **Files Changed:** `js/app.js`, `index.html`, `sitemap.xml`, `js/registry.js`, new `scripts/build-static-pages.js`, plus 68 generated `/<id>/index.html` files.
- **Why It Works:** Google now sees 68 distinct, content-rich, independently indexable URLs instead of one thin homepage. Each has real text content that justifies its ad placements. The SPA experience is unaffected for real users — hash nav and pushState nav both route through the same `goToTool()`/`loadTool()` path.
- **Bonus fixes discovered along the way:** 5 tools (`tip-split`, `date-diff`, `cooking-convert`, `matrix-ops`, `time-zone`) had a `registerTool({id: ...})` value that didn't match their filename, so `fetchTool()`'s dynamic `<script src="js/tools/${id}.js">` 404'd — these were silently broken/unreachable for real users. Also `js/tools/emi.js` had a genuine syntax error (a missing closing brace for `mount()`) that made the entire file fail to parse, breaking the EMI calculator site-wide.

**Prevention:**
- **Rule or Pattern:** Any SPA that relies on client-side routing (hash or pushState) for distinct content **must** have a static-rendering or SSR fallback per route before submitting to AdSense or expecting Google indexing — hash fragments are never crawled as separate URLs, and even pushState routes need something to serve on a direct/first hit.
- **Future Safeguard:** Run `node scripts/build-static-pages.js` after any change to `js/tools/*.js`, `js/registry.js`, or the `index.html` shell, and before every deploy. When adding a new tool, verify its `id:` matches its filename (this is what broke 5 tools silently) and run `node --check js/tools/<file>.js` to catch syntax errors before they ship.

## Bug 004 — Router hijacked non-tool hashes; lazy-load script path broke on subpages; 34 tools had duplicate/misplaced result cards

**Bug (three related issues found during a full audit after Bug 003 shipped):**
1. **Relative script path broke tool switching from any subpage.** `fetchTool()` loaded lazy tool scripts via `js/tools/${id}.js` (relative). From the root this resolved fine, but from any of the 68 real-path subpages (e.g. `/mortgage/`) it resolved to `/mortgage/js/tools/salary.js`, 404'd, and silently fell back to the home screen — breaking sidebar navigation for any tool not already preloaded on the current page.
2. **Router treated any non-empty hash as a tool id.** The topbar's category quick-links (`#all-calculators-list-finance` etc.) and "Browse all tools" link aren't tool ids. Clicking them set a hash, `route()` tried to `fetchTool()` a nonexistent script, failed, and called `showHome()` — destroying whatever calculator the user was currently looking at.
3. **34 tools manually created a second result card instead of using the one `buildToolShell()` already renders.** Some (`document.createElement` + `appendChild`) appended a duplicate at the very end of the view, after the SEO article — so results appeared far below the inputs while the correctly-positioned auto-generated card sat stuck on its placeholder text forever. Others (`container.innerHTML += '<div id="result-card-X">'`) had an id mismatch with the tool's actual `id` (e.g. `result-card-cc` vs the real `result-card-credit-card-payoff`), causing the same misplacement. One (`tip-split.js`) queried the *old* pre-rename id and got `null`, so `calc()` threw on mount and the tool crashed back to the home screen every time — completely inaccessible. A few more (`age`, `bac`, `emi`, etc.) had a duplicate with a *matching* id, which is technically invalid HTML but happened to still render in the right place since `querySelector` returns the first match.

**Fix:**
- **Summary:** Made the dynamic script loader path root-relative (`/js/tools/${id}.js`). Changed `route()` to only treat a hash as a tool id if it actually matches a registered tool; any other non-empty hash now leaves the current view alone instead of bouncing to home. Rewrote all 34 affected tools' `mount()` functions to query the existing `#result-card-<tool.id>` div (matching the standard pattern used by `bmi.js`/`mortgage.js`/etc.) instead of creating a second one, and added missing `.active` class / `pulseResult()` calls for visual consistency. Also fixed a stray leftover `"` character in two tools' `seoContent` and a missing initial `calc()` call in `duration.js`.
- **Files Changed:** `js/app.js`; `js/tools/tip-split.js`, `time-zone.js`, `matrix-ops.js`, `cooking-convert.js`, `date-diff.js`, `cone.js`, `matrix.js`, `trapezoid.js`, `sphere.js`, `savings-goal.js`, `rectangle.js`, `polygon.js`, `parallelogram.js`, `logarithm.js`, `gcdlcm.js`, `factorial.js`, `exponent.js`, `ellipse.js`, `cylinder.js`, `cube.js`, `credit-card-payoff.js`, `pythagorean.js`, `quadratic.js`, `kitchen.js`, `age.js`, `autoloan.js`, `bac.js`, `amortization.js`, `aspect.js`, `bodyfat.js`, `duration.js`, `freelancetax.js`, `gpa.js`, `inflation.js`, `macro.js`, `onerepmax.js`, `retirement.js`, `emi.js`.
- **Why It Works:** Every tool now reuses the single result card `buildToolShell()`/the static build already renders in the correct position, so there's exactly one live, correctly-placed result area per tool with no duplicate/invalid ids. The router only reroutes on hashes it actually recognizes, so unrelated in-page anchors can't blow away the current view.

**Prevention:**
- **Rule or Pattern:** Never `document.createElement` or `innerHTML +=` a second `#result-card-<id>` inside `mount()` — `buildToolShell()` already renders exactly one, at `#result-card-${tool.id}`; always `container.querySelector()` it. Any asset or script path referenced from JS at runtime must be root-relative (leading `/`), never relative, since tool pages can be served from any depth.
- **Future Safeguard:** When adding a new tool, copy the `mount()` skeleton from `bmi.js` or `circle.js` (query the existing result card, no manual creation) rather than an older tool that might carry this pattern forward. Before shipping a router change, manually click through at least one internal link chain starting from a non-home page, not just from `/`.

**Follow-up — full QA sweep completed:** After this bug shipped, all 68 tools in `js/tools/` were individually read and cross-checked (not just the 38 touched above) for: syntax validity, duplicate/misplaced result cards, `result-card-*` id mismatches against the tool's own declared `id`, and a missing initial render call on mount. The remaining 30 tools not covered above (`compound`, `gas`, `idealweight`, `percentage`, `prime`, `salary`, `scientific`, `study-planner`, `tdee`, `tip`, `triangle`, `unit`, `water`, `contact`, `privacy`, `terms`, plus the 14 confirmed correct during the Bug 003 `seoContent` expansion pass — `word-counter`, `circle`, `scientific-notation`, `simple-interest`, `final-grade`, `binaryhex`, `grade`, `password`, `roi`, `pregnancy`, `stddev`, `fraction`, `bmi`, `mortgage`) were all confirmed clean — no fixes needed. The whole 68-tool set now passes an automated check for all four issue classes above; see the one-liner in the Future Safeguard above for what to re-run before every future tool addition.

**Follow-up — automated regression guard added:** `scripts/verify-tools.js` now runs the same checks (syntax, duplicate result-card creation, id/filename mismatch, `result-card-*` id mismatch, and registry.js stub sync) against every tool file, and is wired as a git pre-commit hook via the tracked `.githooks/` directory (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks` — already set for this repo; re-run that one command after a fresh clone). Verified it actually catches all four injected bug types before enabling it.

## Bug 005 — Ad density too high on the homepage

**Bug:**
- **Description:** The homepage carried Zone A (header banner) *and* Zone A2 (a second leaderboard banner embedded in the hero/featured area), plus a multiplex ad injected between every pair of adjacent categories in "The Complete Grid" (up to 5 extra ad slots for 6 categories). Combined, a single homepage load could render 7+ ad units before counting Zone B (sidebar) and Zone D (footer) — a much higher ad-to-content ratio than the actual page content justified, and a plausible contributor to an "ads without publisher content" style rejection even after the content-depth and crawlability fixes.
- **Location:** `js/app.js` (`homeScreenHTML()`, `renderCompleteGrid()`), `index.html` (static home-screen shell), `styles.css` (`.ad-zone-multiplex`, `.ad-zone-inline`).

**Fix:**
- **Summary:** Removed the multiplex ads between categories in `renderCompleteGrid()` entirely. Removed the redundant Zone A2 inline banner from both the static `index.html` shell and `homeScreenHTML()`'s rebuild path, keeping only the single Zone A header banner. Removed the now-dead `.ad-zone-multiplex` / `.ad-zone-inline` CSS rules.
- **Why It Works:** The homepage now carries 3 ad zones (A, B, D) instead of up to 7+, all in standard, well-separated placements. Tool pages are unaffected — they never had A2 or multiplex ads and keep their existing 4-zone layout (A, B, C, D).

**Prevention:**
- **Rule or Pattern:** Before adding any new ad placement, count how many ad units the page will render simultaneously and weigh that against the actual unique content on screen — density, not just word count, is what "ads without publisher content" flags.

## Bug 006 — 14 tools shared verbatim templated seoContent

**Bug:**
- **Description:** `cone`, `cube`, `cylinder`, `ellipse`, `exponent`, `factorial`, `gcdlcm`, `logarithm`, `matrix`, `parallelogram`, `polygon`, `rectangle`, `sphere`, and `trapezoid` all cleared the 300-word bar from Bug 002/003, but shared near-identical opening structure (three generic paragraphs: "The X Calculator is a [comprehensive/specialized/powerful] online tool...", an applications list, then "This free online X Calculator is designed for accuracy, speed, and ease of use... Bookmark this page...") and an identical closing CTA ("Try the X Calculator now... share it with classmates, colleagues..."). Google's content-quality systems weigh uniqueness, not just word count — a pattern repeated verbatim across 14 pages reads as templated/thin regardless of length.
- **Location:** `js/tools/{cone,cube,cylinder,ellipse,exponent,factorial,gcdlcm,logarithm,matrix,parallelogram,polygon,rectangle,sphere,trapezoid}.js` — the `seoContent` property in each.

**Fix:**
- **Summary:** Rewrote all 14 from scratch with distinct openings (each starts from a different real-world hook — Kepler's ellipse orbits, the rice-on-a-chessboard exponent story, honeycomb hexagons, etc.), varied section structure (no two follow the same header pattern), worked examples using each tool's actual default input values, and unique FAQ questions. No generic "Try the X Calculator now" closer anywhere.
- **Files Changed:** the 14 files listed above.
- **Why It Works:** Removes the single largest remaining templated-content signal in the codebase — each page now reads as independently written, with genuine unique facts, formulas tied to real default values, and distinct framing, rather than a mail-merge of the same three paragraphs.

**Prevention:**
- **Rule or Pattern:** Never reuse the same opening/closing sentence structure across multiple tools' `seoContent`, even if the words are swapped per-topic — grep for a few of your own stock phrases (e.g. `grep -rl "designed for accuracy, speed, and ease of use" js/tools/`) before considering a batch of new tools done, and treat any hit count above 1 as a signal to rewrite.

## Bug 007 — Only one hardcoded JSON-LD block, wrong on 67/68 pages

**Bug:**
- **Description:** `index.html` carried exactly one `SoftwareApplication` JSON-LD block, hardcoded for Mortgage (`"name": "Mortgage Calculator"`, `"url": ".../mortgage/"`), sitting in the shared `<head>`. Since every one of the 68 static pages is generated from this same shell, every non-mortgage page was publishing structured data claiming to be the Mortgage Calculator. It also used `"applicationCategory": "FinancialApplication"`, which isn't a valid schema.org enum value (the real one is `FinanceApplication`) — so the one page it was meant for was invalid too. Meanwhile, the rich FAQ `<details>` content already written into most tools' `seoContent` had no structured-data representation at all, missing an easy shot at FAQPage rich snippets in search results.
- **Location:** `index.html` (the hardcoded block, in the shared `<head>`).

**Fix:**
- **Summary:** Removed the hardcoded block. Added `buildJsonLd()` to `scripts/build-static-pages.js`, which generates a correct, tool-specific `SoftwareApplication` schema for every non-Legal tool (using the real `applicationCategory` enum, mapped per category: Finance→FinanceApplication, Health→HealthApplication, Education→EducationalApplication, everything else→UtilityApplication), plus a `FAQPage` schema extracted directly from each tool's `<details><summary>` FAQ items via `extractFaqItems()`. `contact`/`privacy`/`terms` (category `Legal`) correctly get no SoftwareApplication schema, since they aren't applications. The homepage's generic `WebSite`/`SearchAction` schema is untouched.
- **Files Changed:** `index.html`, `scripts/build-static-pages.js`.
- **Why It Works:** Each of the 65 non-Legal tools now publishes accurate, unique structured data matching its own name/URL/description, and the FAQ content already written gets a real shot at FAQPage rich snippets instead of being invisible to search engines' structured-data parsers. Validated all 190 generated JSON-LD blocks across all 68 pages parse as valid JSON before shipping.

**Prevention:**
- **Rule or Pattern:** Structured data must be generated per-page from the same data source as the page's own content (the `tool` object), never hardcoded once in a shared template — a shared template with page-specific JSON-LD is a contradiction that will always be wrong on every page except the one it was written for.

## Bug 006 (follow-up) — Second, milder templated pattern: repeated section headers

**Bug:**
- **Description:** After de-templatizing the 14 tools with verbatim boilerplate sentences, a second pass found 21 more tools reusing the exact bare headers `<h3>How the Calculator Works</h3>` and `<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>` with zero variation (`autoloan`, `compound`, `credit-card-payoff`, `duration`, `freelancetax`, `gas`, `gpa`, `idealweight`, `inflation`, `macro`, `pythagorean`, `quadratic`, `retirement`, `savings-goal`, `study-planner`, plus `age`, `amortization`, `aspect`, `bac`, `bodyfat`, `emi` for the FAQ header alone). Unlike Bug 006's verbatim-sentence case, the actual body content (bullet points, FAQ answers) under these headers was genuinely unique per tool — repeating a generic section label like "Frequently Asked Questions" isn't itself a duplicate-content signal (virtually every FAQ page on the web uses that exact phrase). Still worth closing out for consistency once flagged.
- **Location:** the 21 files listed above.

**Fix:**
- **Summary:** Renamed every bare header to be tool-specific (e.g., `<h3>How the Calculator Works</h3>` → `<h3>How the Gas Cost Calculator Works</h3>`; `<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>` → `<h3>Gas Cost — Frequently Asked Questions</h3>`). Pure relabeling — no body content touched.
- **Why It Works:** Every `<h3>` on every tool page is now uniquely worded; combined with Bug 006's sentence-level fix, there is no remaining repeated phrase (verbatim or structural) anywhere across the 68 tools' `seoContent`.

**Prevention:**
- **Rule or Pattern:** When auditing for templated content, check both levels: exact repeated *sentences* (the more serious signal) and repeated *section headers* (a milder, cosmetic signal, but easy to fix once noticed) — `grep -rl "<h3>SOME_HEADER</h3>" js/tools/` for any header you're about to reuse across multiple new tools.
